The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a subtle bug that can occur when using `calc()` with percentages and other units.  Consider this scenario:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

In this example, you might expect `.element` to be 10px narrower than its parent. However, the calculation is not always performed as expected due to the order of operations and rounding issues.  The browser might first calculate 50% of the parent's width and then subtract 10px, leading to unexpected results. This is especially problematic when dealing with nested elements and complex layouts.
